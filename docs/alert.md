# Alerts



```{note}
Your dashboard may not warn you if you enter an invalid Channel ID manually! Before continuing, make sure the dashboard correctly loaded the channel name in your 'Summary' section (under the new alert).

## Clip Alerts

There are two types of Clip Alerts: `New Clip`

and `Trending Clip`.

Add the `New Clip` alert to receive a notification when a new clip is posted in the selected channel. 

The `Trending Clip` alert will notify you when a clip enters the 'top' section for its corresponding Twitch Channel.

Use whichever clip alert type you prefer, or both!
