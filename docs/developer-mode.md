# Discord Developer Mode

## What is Developer Mode?

Discord Developer Mode is a feature that allows you to see the IDs of various elements in Discord. This is useful for many reasons, such as:

- Identifying the ID of a user, server, or channel.
- Debugging issues with bots or other Discord features.
- Providing debugging information to developers.

Note that Developer Mode is **not needed** for using CLYPPY. This guide merely serves as a reference for those who want to use it.
